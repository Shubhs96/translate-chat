Personal hackathon project at Fullstack Academy. Translate Chat is a prototype of a hybrid mobile messaging app whose purpose is to help  users overcome language barriers by translating texts in real time, catered to each recipient’s language needs. Users can set their source language, have one-on-one chats with friends and select their target translation language for each friend. Has a live preview that shows texts being translated as the user types, and chats display both the original text and the translated text for easy comprehension.
•	Integrates Ionic framework, Twilio, and Node/Express server to  programmatically sends and receives translated text messages. 
•	Uses Firebase for real-time data storage/syncing  and Google Translate API to support real-time translations between 90 languages.
