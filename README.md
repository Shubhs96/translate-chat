Translate Chat is a prototype of a hybrid mobile messaging app whose goal is help users overcome language barriers by translating texts as they chat in real time, catered to each recipientâ€™s language needs. Translate Chat was created as a personal hackathon project at Fullstack Academy in NYC.

Features

- Users can set their desired source language for receiving texts (ie. receiving texts in Chinese)
- Users can also set individual target languages for each person with whom they chat (ie. setting texts for one friend to be translated in Spanish)
- Chat view includes a live preview that shows texts being translated as the user types
- Chat view displays both the original text input by the sender and the translated text for easy comprehension

Technologies

- Integrates Ionic framework, Twilio, and Node/Express server to programmatically send and receive translated text messages
- Uses Firebase for real-time data storage/syncing  and Google Translate API to support translations between 90 languages
