Translate Chat is a prototype of a hybrid mobile messaging app whose goal is help users overcome language barriers by translating texts as they chat in real time, catered to each recipientâ€™s language needs. Translate Chat was created as a personal hackathon project at Fullstack Academy in NYC.

Features

- Chat view includes a live translation preview that shows texts being translated as the user types
